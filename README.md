Fig. 1. The schematic of machine learning (ML) assisted composition design of Fe-Ni-Ti-Al novel maraging steel (NMS). (a) Feature selections in the design of NMS, (b) data collections from Thermo-Calc® software and the correlation matrix of the input composition (Ni, Ti and Al) and output (Ni3Ti precipitate and Laves phase weight fractions) in the surrogate models, (c) ML by various algorithms (Random Forest is the most accurate one), (d) composition optimization for the allowable range of alloying elements, (e) time-dependent dynamic precipitation behaviours of different compositions at 490 ºC (the balance is Fe), and (f) final decisive composition as Fe-20.8Ni-6.2Ti-1.7Al (wt %) along with the morphology and elemental mapping of the produced powder.

Fig. 2. Overview of the machining learning customized powder, LDED processes and mechanical properties of the customized Fe-Ni-Ti-Al NMS. (a) Powder particle size distributions. (b) Cross-sectional view, (c) IPF and (d) phase map of powder. (e) Illustrative comparison between 3D printing (3DP) of CMS followed by PHT to form precipitates, and 4D printing (4DP) of ML customized NMS with in-situ formed massive precipitates incited by IHT without PHT. Spatial morphologies of LDED-processed NMS by (f) continuous deposition and (g) interlayer pause (ILP) deposition strategies. (h) Time-dependent thermal histories in continuous and ILP deposition strategies (the Ms=182 ºC). (i) Tensile engineering stress-strain curves of NMS (as-built) and CMS (repeated tensile tests are plotted in Supplementary Fig. S4a). (j) Deformation behaviour of NMS by in-situ DIC monitoring.
